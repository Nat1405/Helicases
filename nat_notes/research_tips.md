# Some miscellaneous research tips

## From Nat

- Work for large, relatively uninterrupted periods of time on research. Try to do at least 20 hours of it in a week, maybe not every week. This is better than 10 hours a week every week because it takes a lot of time to remember where you were and what you were doing.

- *Take Notes*. You'll forget what you're doing (or that great idea you had!) if you don't write it down. Keep a notebook of things you try and things you want to try.

- Blockages: If you've been trying to make something work for two days, or ever feel listless despair (it happens (staring at the wall, just don't know what to do)), ask for help. It's usually not as bad as you think. It's not worth wasting two weeks when a friend could have helped you solve it in two days.

- Attention to detail and following your gut. Constantly ask yourself, "is this right?", and "how can I check?". Doing things multiple ways and cross-checking results are a good way to do this. People are going to ask you "are you sure" and it's really good to be able to honestly say "I'm sure". Don't cut corners. 

- Follow your curiosity!! It should be fun üòÅ

- All advice is optional. You're in control at the end of the day.
