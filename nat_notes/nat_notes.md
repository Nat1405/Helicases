# Nat's Notes to Himself

Just some ill-formed notes to myself

## Nice to Haves



## ToDo

- k-means clustering
- Which identifier components should we use? Which can we throw out, they're useless? 
- Do a quick sanity check on identifier components to explore their properties.
	1) Is name & instrument the same for all identifiers?
	2) Are all their lengths equal?
- Understand move to front, run length, arithmetic encoding.



## Crazy Ideas and Notes

- Can we use NA12878 and GIAB to validate any of these results?
